# Mountain Programming Language
## A (hopefully) fast, C compatible, language designed to enable greatness


Mountain has several core tenants (listed in order of inportance)
1. Expose features which allow for tasks to be accomplished efficiently in
terms of developer time without sacrificing runtime performance to heavily.
2. Readability counts
3. Stay out of the programmer's way and trust that the developer knows what
they are doing.
4. Writability counts


# This language is nowhere near usable for literally anything
This is currently little more than a fun side project with hopes of
eventually becoming more. Read the feature wishlist
[here](WISHLIST.md) for more information about what Mountain hopes to
be capable of. Feel free to poke around and help if you want. Dunno,
Cheers!
