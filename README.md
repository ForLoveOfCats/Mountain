# Mountain Programming Language
## A (hopefully) fast, C compatible, language designed to enable greatness


### Welcome to the Github repo for the (WIP) Mountain bootstrap compiler

The goal is to have a self hosted compiler by the end of
summer 2020. At the moment Mountain rather far away from that goal.


### Core Tenants

Mountain has several core tenants
* Expressiveness without sacrificing runtime performance.
* Explicitness is important for readability.
    * Explicit != Verbose
* Seamless C interop is important for usefulness.
* It is not the language's job to enforce a specific coding "style".



# This language is nowhere near usable for literally anything
This is currently little more than a fun side project with hopes of
eventually becoming more. Read the feature wishlist
[here](WISHLIST.md) for more information about what Mountain hopes to
be capable of. Feel free to poke around and help if you want. Dunno,
Cheers!
